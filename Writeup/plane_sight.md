Download the file to your machine for analysis

Running the ```exiftool``` command you'll find something interesting

command:```exiftool mashle.jpg```

Similar to the "S1mple" chall you'll find out that what we have there is actually not a cipher, it is an encoding. Yeah, it's a cyrillic encoding

We can use this [webpage](https://2cyr.com/decode/?lang=en) to decode

Well, that's a very weird output. Lets try to select a successful sample

That looks less weird hehe, apparently it's not an encoding, it's a language. This means we can use google translator to translate this

We still have to translate this

Now, this makes more sense but then it didn't work when I tried ```ACTF{flag=17>>5_a11_1n_Th3_m3T4d473}```, we could have guessed this though to say ```it's all in the metadata``` so that'll be ```ACTF{flag=17'5_a11_1n_Th3_m3T4d473}``` but then it still didn't work.

Apparently I was meant to remove the ```flag=```

FLAG:-```ACTF{17'5_a11_1n_Th3_m3T4d473}```

Now, this is actually not the way to goðŸ˜‚, what if it is not a guessable word??

As you can seeðŸ˜‚

That's why I had to use another cyrillic decoder, you can see it [here](https://convertcyrillic.com/#/)

After several tries, I got this

Yup, that's the proper way of solving it
